## React Parcel Bundler Practice


### Description
This repo was created after hearing about `Parcel Bundler`. Parcel Bundler replaces webpack for react and makes it simplier to get a react project started without the need for configurations. This repo is a starter example of what an initial react app usin this bundler will look like and may be used by myself in the future as a reminder how to get up and running with Parcel Bundler.

### How to Run this App
  1. Clone this repo
  2. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
  3. Run the app: `npm run start`
  4. Visit `localhost:1234`

### Notes
Once you start the application using the steps above, Parcel Bunder takes care of hot reloading, so any changes made to the project will be instantly available and visible without the need for a page refresh, how epic'ly awesome is that :)
